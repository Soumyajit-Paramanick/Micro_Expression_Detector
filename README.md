# MicroSense: The Micro Expression Detector

## Introduction

**MicroSense** is a deep learning-based project designed to detect micro-expressions in uploaded videos. Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal true emotions. This tool can be used in psychological studies, security, and human-computer interaction research.
